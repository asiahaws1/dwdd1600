            <p>At Vintage Fashion, we  <strong>LOVE vintage clothing!</strong> Our team is always on the look-out for the hottest upcoming trends, and we are always updating our inventory! Let us help you
                in the search of cultivating your stylish vintage closet. We offer vintage clothing of all price ranges, and we are proud to feature our <a href="signers.html#finds">Rare Finds</a> some of the 
                hottest, most-sought after fashion pieces on the market!  We are your biggest supporters in making your vintage dreams come true. 
            <strong>We first began </strong> our love for vintage clothing in the summer of 2016, when our founder, Asia Haws, found her love for vintage clothing by cultivating outfits she found second-hand 
        for herself, friends, family, and others. From there, we have expanded to make sure people like YOU are able to fill their style needs. We are your one-stop vintage shop dedicated to making sure you look and feel good!</p>
             <p><a href="signers.html#promise">Our Promise</a> is to provide the best fashion experience possible for our customers, <em>so we make sure our rare and vintage items are authenticated before shipping.</em>

             <h2>Sustainability</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>As a business, we are dedicated to reusing and providing vintage fashion for consumers to choose from.
                    We are mindful of our impact on reducing the carbon footprint. We strive to provide an eco-friendly, fashionable
                    place to learn and provide vintage pieces.</li>
                 <li>We give items a second chance at Vintage Fashion! Our items are second-hand finds that are quality checked before they are shipped. By supporting us, you are helping the fight against fast fashion by 
                    reusing and recycling!
